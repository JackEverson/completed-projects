This Repo contains the code and information about the keboards that I have made. My current daily driver is a Redox keyboard powerered by ZMK which can be seen above. A list of all the keboards I have worked on can be seen below:

- Dactyl Keyboard: currently working on this project
- Redox Bluetooth keyboard: A BLE keyboard powered by ZMK, this is my current daily driver
- 2% Bongo cat: A two key keyboard for controlling volume, powered by QMK
- Redox wired keyboard: The first keyboard I built by hand, powered by KMK
