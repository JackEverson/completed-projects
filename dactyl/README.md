# Dactyl

This keyboard is my current keyboard project. I only have one half printed at this stage but from my testing it is giving me wrist pain. I am contemplating converting to producing a dactyl manuform.

Currently I have a KMK file available in this directory (test_dactyl.py) which I am using for prototyping. You can copy this file into a microcontroller with KMK firmware installed and rename the file to `code.py` if you would like to use it.

3D print files are not mine, but can be found on Printables.com website [here](https://www.printables.com/model/60567-nano-dactyl-cc)
