# Redox split keyboard 

This is the Redox keyboard I have made from scratch. The frame is made from 3d printed, PLA plastic parts. Wiring and soldering was done by hand (no PCB). The Microcontroller is a Raspberry Pi Pico running with Circuit Python (https://circuitpython.org/) and utilising the KMK keyboard libray (http://kmkfw.io/)
While this project is in the 'finished projects folder', it is more accurate to refer to it as in a useable. That is I intend to continue developing on it until it suits what I like in a keyboard or I start to build a new keyboard. 

This directory contains two folders, 'redox_code' which is stable working code that is currently working on the keyboard, and 'test_redox_code' which is unstable code that I am working on to introduce new features. To copy my code it should be as simple as installing Circuit Python on your desired microcontroller and then copy and pasting the contents of the redox_code folder into your device.

The things I am looking to implement in the future are:

-Working Layers to give a access to all keyboard symbols and a number pad
-Setting up some macros that can automate repetive tasks


Below are some photo's of the making process:
