# Redox split keyboard 

This is the Redox keyboard I have made from scratch. The frame is made from 3d printed, PLA plastic parts. Wiring and soldering was done by hand (no PCB). The Microcontroller is a Raspberry Pi Pico running with Circuit Python (https://circuitpython.org/) and utilising the KMK keyboard libray (http://kmkfw.io/). This repo contains a directory labeled 'redox_code' which is stable working code. To copy my code it should be as simple as installing Circuit Python on your desired microcontroller and then copy and pasting the contents of the redox_code folder into your device.

While I refer to this project as finished I intend to continue developing it. The things I am looking to implement in the future are:

-A new layer that gives access to better motions <br />
-Setting up some macros that can automate repetive tasks <br />
-~~buying new keycaps (filiment 3d printed keycaps have turned out to be quite scratchy)~~ <br />
